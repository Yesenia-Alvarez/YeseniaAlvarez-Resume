        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Yesenia Alvarez and I’m from Rialto, California. I’m pursuing a marketing career. I have a high school diploma from Jurupa Hills High School. Currently, I am a student at UC Riverside and it is my first year. My major is Pre-Business and am working towards my degree. I am self-disciplined for the most part and strive to do my best work. I enjoy cooperating and working with others on a certain task. Marketing is an interesting field to me and I’m working on getting an internship soon to gain more experience. I am honest and accountable when I work. I like to work and learn about technology because it is an essential skill due to the changes in technology throughout the years. <br><br>

        I like to learn about the new technology and features available because it has an impact on humans. It changes the ways in which we do certain things. As for my hobbies, I like to listen to a variety of music. I like to go out on walks/runs and enjoy the outdoors. I also have a sibling and sometimes we watch movies or TV shows. I also like to walk my dog around the neighborhood. I do my school assignments and prepare for my classes. I like to stay organized with my workspace and keep tidy. At times, I watch Netflix or go on social media, but not for too long because I would like to do something more productive or beneficial for me. I also read books in my free time. I tend to stay organized by having a planner or writing down a to-do list with due dates on my assignments. This helps me stay on track with my school assignments. I also write down notes on my laptop and make separate folders for my classes. <br><br>

       My first year at UC Riverside has been good so far and I’m looking forward to the next quarters as well. Hopefully, Covid-19 will be over soon, so that in-person classes will be back, and school will be back to normal. I’ve been learning many new things since I started college and I’m learning more about managing my time wisely in order to stay on track with due dates. I’m learning about the quarter system instead of semester system. I’ve explored different ways to study and retain information. I’m also exploring different clubs and organizations at UC Riverside because there is a variety. I want to be more involved with organizations once things go back to normal with the Covid-19 situation. All in all, my first year at UC Riverside is going well so far and business is an interesting field that I would want to pursue. There are many opportunities at UC Riverside to learn more about this field and gain experience. I want to stay on track to complete my degree in 4 years.
